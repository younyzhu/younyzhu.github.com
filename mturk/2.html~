    Your task is to re-arrange components in graphs (biological pathways)
    to produce legible and
    aesthetically pleasing layout.</p>
	There are some numbers displayed on the screen (e.g., number of edge crossing, number of downward edges, etc.) You must minimize those numbers as much as you can.
	<p>
	All edges are directional. 
	<p>
	The end result must have clear flow of the information. Edges should pointing downwards.
	<p>

	Please feel free to use any strategies you think that will help interpret the structure. 
	<p>
	Please note you must not change the "belonging" relationship, i.e., each node lives in a box and it cannot be moved out of the box.
