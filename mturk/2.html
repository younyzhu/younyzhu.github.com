<h2>2. Your Task</h2>
<p>
    Your task is to re-arrange components in biological pathways
    to produce legible and
    aesthetically pleasing layout.</p>
<p>
    For example, Fig.2(a) is the original pathway graph of "chromosome maintenance", and Fig.2(b) is the re-arranged
    one that obeys the rules in Section 3.1.
</p>
<img alt="simbols" width="1000" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/exp.png"/>
<p style="text-align: center">Fig.2 An Example Pathway "Chromosome maintenance": (a) original layout. (b) new layout.
    The pathway includes two compartments: nucleoplasm and nuclear envelope. </p>
<p>To make your layout acceptable, your graph MUST</p>
<UL>
    <LI> contain less numbers of edge crossing than the time your start.
    <LI> have no nodes overlapping.
    <LI> have no nodes moving out of a compartment.
    <LI> follow other rules in Section 3.1.</LI>
</UL>
<p>To reach these goals, please follow the instruction below.</p>
<h2>3. Introduction</h2>
<p>A pathway graph is represented using
    compartment (blocks), nodes, and edges. Here a compartment(block)
    contains nodes
    and edges as well.
    <br/>
    An example graph is shown below (Table.1):
</p>

<table border="1" style="width:600px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
    <tr>
        <td> A pathway graph</td>
        <td> Nodes and their Relationships</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img alt="simbols" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/fig31.PNG"/></td>
        <td>
            <p>
                <b>Compartments (blocks)</b>: G, H<br>
                <b>Nodes</b>: A, B, C , D, E, F<br>
                <b>Edges</b>: E->F, F->C, C->A, C->D, B->D, D->A
            <p>
                All edges are directional, each of which have a start point and an endpoint.<br/>
            </p>
        </td>
    </tr>

<h3> 3.1 Rules </h3>
Table 2 lists some operation rules. Each rule is illustrated with an example.
Please follow them as much as you can. Following these rules will help you produce more legible and
aesthetically pleasing layout.

<p style="text-align: center">Table.2 Six rules.</p>
<p>
    To make a graph aesthetically pleasing, you may
</p>
<ul>
    <LI> make the nodes evenly distributed in the space.</LI>
    <LI> avoid edge crossing and node overlapping by all means.</LI>
    <LI> resize the compartment to take less screen space.</LI>
    <LI> reize the compartment to fit the nodes better.</LI>
    <LI> balance legibility, node distribution, and edge length.</LI>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Procedures</h3>
<UL>
    <Li>Please open the website through the link provided in the task. An interface, e.g., Fig. 4, will be shown.
        <ul>
            <Li> There are four buttons on the upper right corner of the screen. <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Your Worker ID</b>: for putting your amazon mechnical turk worker Id to get paid.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Send</b>: for saving your layout on our server..<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Numbers of edge crossing</b>: for counting the number of intersecting edges.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Numbers of overlapping nodes</b>: for counting the number of overlapping nodes. <br/>
            </Li>
            <li>You will see a graph taking large portion of the screen. Your task is to re-arrange the graph.</li>
        </ul>
    </Li>
    <LI>Here is the list of mouse actions for graph rearrangement. <br/>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        Move the nodes and compartment by left-mouse drag.
        Resize the compartment by put your cursor on the edge, then left-mouse click and drag it. The selected
        compartment will turns yellow. You can drag the eight
        red-colored widgets on the edges to resize the compartment.
        You can also left-mouse select a group of nodes by holding down the "Ctrl" key on your
        keyboard while using left-mouse selection.</Li>
    <LI> Clicking on the "Number of node overlapping" or the "Number of edge crossings" will allow you to get the
        corresponding numbers of your current layout.
    </Li>
    <LI> When you are done, please input your "worker ID" and then click the "send" button to confirm, clicking "send"  to submit your result.(If you can not find your worker Id,
        please visit <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/dashboard" target="_bank">https://www.mturk.com/mturk/dashboard</a>,
        in your account dashboard, you can find your Worker Id)</Li>
    <li>Please note you should press the "Send" twice, one for confirming your workerId, the other for submitting the result.</li>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p> Please rearrange the layout as fast and carefully as you can.
</p>
<h2>Disclaims</h2>
<p>    We reserve the right not to accept your layout.
    If you think your layout is better but it gets rejected, please contact
    Yongnan Zhu at <a href="mailto:yongnan@umbc.edu">
