    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This study is a supplement of PathBubble for manually adjusting biological pathways.
        If you want to know detailed information, please visit our PathBubble website:

        <b>Procedures</b>:
        In this task, you will be shown a <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway" target = "_bank">
        pathway graph</a>.<br/>
        1. You should carefully move the nodes(elements) of the graph, which should obey the following <a class="toc" href="#rule">Rules</a>. <br/>
        2. During the operation, you can click the <b>Left Crossing</b> button on the <a class="toc" href="#menu">menu control</a>( see image below),
        It will tell you the number of edge crossing right now.<br/>
        3. After finishing arranging the graph, you should find your <b> amazon mechnical turk worker Id </b>, and input your worker Id in the menu. And then press <b>Send</b>,
        it will come out an alert with you work Id, you should make sure you worker Id is correct, and then press <b>Send</b> again.<br/>
        (If you can not find your worker Id, please visit <a href= "https://www.mturk.com/mturk/dashboard" target = "_bank">https://www.mturk.com/mturk/dashboard</a>, in you account dashboard, you can find you <b>Worker Id</b>)

    </p>
    <a name="rule"><h2>Rules</h2></a>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li> Avoid Edge crossing.</li>
        <li> Try to reduce the length of the edges.</li>
        <li> When moving the compartment, nodes inside it should not be moved.</li>
        <li> If the compartment has no connections with other compartment, it should be put on the top. </li>
        <li> In the final graph, the direction of the majority of the arrows should go down. </li>
        <li> All the nodes in a graph should not be overlaped. </li>
        <li> You should balance the trade between the beauty of the graph and uniform distribution of the nodes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Let's take some simple images for example: </h3>
    <b>Simbol illustration:</b>
    <br/><p>In the following examples, we will show you some graph images, and guide you how to arrange it.
    Here, We should make an agreement on some terms. A graph is consist of nodes, edges. As you can see from the image below:
    <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are two nodes, Edges <b>C</b> connects those two nodes. And we call <b>D</b> as compartment,
    which is the container of those nodes and edges groups.
    <br/>
    <img alt="simbols" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/simbols.PNG"/>
    <br/>
    <h4>Example 1</h4>
    <p>
        <img alt="edge_crossing" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/edge_crossing.PNG"/>
        <br/>
        As you can see from this image, there is a crossing, so you need to move the node to avoid this Edge crossing(Rule 1).
        You can move the node <b> C </b>,
        you can move the node <b> A </b> or you can move node <b> D</b>. It's up to you. Here I move the mode <b> C </b>.
        <img alt="edge_crossing1" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/edge_crossing1.PNG"/>
        <br/>After this, you will find there are too many horizonizal arrows, From <b> Rule 5 </b>, we should make the arrow go down.
        <img alt="edge_crossing2.PNG" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/edge_crossing2.PNG"/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <h4>Example 2</h4>
    <p>
        <img alt="length" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/length.PNG"/>
        <br/>As you can see, there are two compartments in a graph, there is an edge <b>C F</b> that combines nodes of those compartments.
        However, <b>C F</b> is too long, we need to make it shorter, and also the direction of Arrow <b>C A </b> is not going down.
        We can exchange Node<b> A </b>and Node <b> C </b>.
        <img alt="length1" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/length1.PNG"/>
        <br/>Here you can see the length of the  <b>C F</b> is almost the distance of the two compartments. Also you can exchanged the  <b>E F</b> to make it shorter.
        <br/>
    </p>

    <h4>Example 3</h4>
    <p>
        <img alt="overlap" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/overlap.PNG"/>
        <br/>Here you can see Node <b>D</b> and Node <b>E</b> are overlaped together. From <b>Rule Six </b> we should avoid node overlapping. So we need to split them.
        <img alt="overlap" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/overlap1.PNG"/>
        <br/>
    </p>

    <h2>Note about Payment</h2>
    <p> We will rate each graph very carefully.
        <br/>Your time and mouse activity will be recoded, please take this task seriously.
        <br/>We do try to be fairly lenient,
        but if your work are terribly bad (like you randomly drag the graph or do not obey the rules),
        we reserve the right to not accept it.
        <br/>All the data will be used in a scientific study, please do it carefully.
        <br/>
