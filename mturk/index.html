<h2>2. Your Task</h2>
<p>
    Your task is to re-arrange components in biological pathways
    to produce legible and
    aesthetically pleasing layout.</p>
<p>
    For example, Fig.2(a) is the original pathway graph whose name is "chromosome maintenance", and Fig.2(b) is the re-arranged
    one that obeys the rules in Section 3.1.

<p style="text-align: center">Fig.2 An Example Task and Result.</p>
<p>To make your layout acceptable, your graph MUST</p>
<UL>
    <LI> contain less numbers of edge intersection than the time your start.
    <LI> have no nodes overlapping.
    <LI> have no nodes moving out of a compartment.
</UL>
<p>To reach these goals, please follow the instruction.</p>
<h2>3. Introduction</h2>
<p>A pathway graph is represented using
    compartment (blocks), nodes, and edges. Here a compartment(block)
    contains nodes
    and edges as well.
    <br/>
    An example graph is shown below (Table.1):
</p>

<table border="1" style="width:600px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
    <tr>
        <td> A simple pathway graph</td>
        <td> Some illustrations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img alt="simbols" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/fig31.PNG"/></td>
        <td>
            <p>
                <b>Compartments (blocks)</b>: G, H<br>
                <b>Nodes</b>: A, B, C , D, E, F<br>
                <b>Edges</b>: E->F, F->C, C->A, C->D, B->D
                <br>
                All edges are directional, which have a start point and an endpoint.<br/>
            </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
 </table>

<h3> 3.1 Rules </h3>
Here are some rules of thumb with examples
that will help you re-arrange the graph
to produce more legible and
aesthetically pleasing layout.

<p style="text-align: center">Table.2 Six rules.</p>
<p>
    To make a graph aesthetically pleasing, you may
</p>
<ul>
    <LI> make the nodes evenly distributed in the space.</LI>
    <LI> avoid edge intersection and node overlapping by all means.</LI>
    <LI> resize the compartment to take less screen space.</LI>
    <LI> reize the compartment to fit better.</LI>
    <LI> make sure the graph balance legibility and node distance or edge length.</LI>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Procedures</h3>
<UL>
    <Li>Please open the website through the link we give you in each task, After you open the website you will see an interface
        like this (see Fig.4 Interface below)<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In the right corner of the screen is the menu bar, which has 4 types of buttons:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stop Force Direct</b>: you can press this to stop automatic layout.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Number of edge intersection</b>: you can press this to detect how many edge intersection in the current graph.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Your Worker ID</b>: you should input your amazon mechnical turk worker Id to get the pay.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Send</b>: After you finish your work and input you worker ID, you can send the data to our server.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the center of the interface, you will see many nodes in the compartment which are moving automatically.
        (We automatically layout the graph, when loading the graph)<br/>
    </Li>
    <Li>After you find all the nodes become stable, or the number of the nodes overlapping and edges intersection is less, you can press the <b>Stop Force Direct</b>
        in the menubar to stop the automatic adjust. And then you can press any spare space in the screen, it will show you the graph you need to adjust.</Li>
    <LI>You may begin by dragging the nodes and compartments by clicking left mouse.
        Compartment are also resizable. To do this, you can click the empty
        space in an compartment, you will see the compartment turns yellow and eight
        red-colored widgets on the edges. You may
        drag the widgets to resize it).
        You can also select a group of nodes by holding down the "Ctrl" key on your
        keyboard while using left-mouse selection.</Li>
    <LI> You may save intermedidate results. To save your result,
        put your "worker ID" in the menu bar which is located in the upper right corner of the screen
        and then click the "send" button.</Li>
    <LI> You can click "Number of edge intersection" to test whether or not your layout
        is valid (fewer the better.) The original number of edge intersection is displayed
        on the screen already.</Li>
    <LI> When you are done, again, put your "worker ID" and click the "send" button.</Li>
    <LI> Just in case you put in a wrong "worker ID", simply put it again.</Li>
</UL>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p> Please rearrange the layout as fast and carefully as you can.
    All of your activities will be recorded including mouse actions and times.
 </p>
<h2>Disclaims</h2>
<p>We do try to be fairly lenient,
    but if your work are terribly bad (like you randomly drag the nodes of the graph and do not obey the rules described above),
    we reserve the right not to accept it
If you think your layout is better but your layout gets rejected, please contact
