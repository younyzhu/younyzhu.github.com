    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a supplement tool of PathBubble for manually adjusting biological pathways. If you want to know detail information, please visit our PathBubble website:
        <a class="link" href="http://sites.google.com/a/umbc.edu/pathbubbles/pathbubbles-1-0/pathbubbles-wiki" target = "_bank"> PathBubble</a> <br/>
        In these task, you will be show a <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway" target = "_bank"> pathway graph</a>.
        You should carefully move the elements of the graph which should obey the following rules.
    </p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li><b> Avoid Edge crossing</b></li>
        <li><b> Try to reduce the length of the edges</b></li>
        <li><b> When moving the compartment, the block nodes inside should not be moved</b></li>
        <li><b> If the compartment has no connections with other compartment, it should be put on the top. </b></li>
        <li><b> In the final graph, the direction of the majority of the arrows should go down. </b></li>
        <li><b> the nodes in a graph should not be overlaped </b></li>
        <li><b>You should balance the trade between the beauty of the graph and uniform distribution of the nodes.</b></li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3> Let's take some simple images for example: </h3>

    <h4>Example 1</h4>
    <p>
        <img alt="edge_crossing" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/edge_crossing.PNG"/>
        <br/>
        As you can see from this images, there is a crossing here, so you need to move the node to avoid Edge crossing(Rule 1). You can move the <b> node C </b>, you can move the <b> node A </b> or you can <b> move node D</b>. It's up to you. Here I move the mode C.
        <img alt="edge_crossing1" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/edge_crossing1.PNG"/>
        <br/>After this, you will find there are too many horizonizal arrows, From <b> Rule 5 </b>, we should make the arrow go down.
        <img alt="edge_crossing2.PNG" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/edge_crossing2.PNG"/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <h4>Example 2</h4>
    <p>
        <img alt="length" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/length.PNG"/>
        <br/>As you can see, two compartments in a graph, there is an edge <b>C F</b> that combines the compartments. However, CF is too long, we need to make it shorter, and also the direction of Arrow <b>C A </b> is not going down.  So we can exchange Node A and Node C.
        <img alt="length1" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/length1.PNG"/>
        <br/>Here you can see The length of the CF is almost the distance of the two compartments. Also you can exchanged the E F to make it shorter.
        <br/>
    </p>

    <h4>Example 3</h4>
    <p>
        <img alt="overlap" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/overlap.PNG"/>
        <br/>Here you can see The Node D and node E are overlaped together. From <b>Rule Six </b> we should avoid node overlapping. So we need to split them.
        <img alt="overlap" width="380" height="380" src="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~yongnan/images/overlap1.PNG"/>
        <br/>
    </p>

    <h2>Note about Payment</h2>
    <p> We will rate each graph very carefully. We do try to be fairly lenient,
        but if your work are terribly bad (like you randomly drag the graph or do not obey the rules),
        we reserve the right to not accept it. All the data will be used in a scientific study,
        please do it carefully.<br/>
